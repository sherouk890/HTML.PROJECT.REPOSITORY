<P>The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a number of specific sub-problems
 These consist of specific traits or capabilities that researchers would like to embody in an intelligent system.
 The features listed below have received the most attention.<P/>
 <P>Reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving ability<P/>
 <P>The first researchers in the science of artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the sequential logical reasoning that
 humans do when solving puzzles, playing backgammon or logical deductions.<P/>
 <P>In the 1980s and 1990s, artificial intelligence research led to highly successful methods of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information,
 using concepts from probability and economics.<P/>
 <P>For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require huge computational resourcesâ€”resulting in a "combinatorial explosion":
 the amount of memory or time needed for computers becomes astronomical when the problem exceeds a certain size.
 The search for algorithms that are more capable of solving problems is a top priority for AI research.<P/>
 <P>Humans solve most of their problems using intuitive, rather than conscious, quick judgments,
 by step-by-step deduction that early AI researchers were able to simulate automatically.
 AI research has made some progress in imitating this "sub-symbolic" type of problem-solving skills:
 the approaches involved underscore the importance of sensorimotor skills for higher thinking;
 It attempts to research in the field of neural networks and simulate the structures inside the human and animal brain that lead to the emergence
 of this skill.<P/>
