<P>In the mid-20th century, a few scientists began exploring a new approach to building intelligent machines,
 based on recent discoveries in neuroscience, a new mathematical theory of information, the development of cybernetics, and above all,
 by the invention of the digital computer, a machine that could simulate The human computational thinking process.<P/>
 
 <P>He established the modern field of artificial intelligence research at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956. 
 These attendees became leaders in artificial intelligence research for several decades, notably John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky,
 Allen Noel and Herbert Simon who established artificial intelligence laboratories at MIT and the University of Carnegie Mellon (CMU)
 and Stanford, they and their students wrote programs that surprised most people.
 The computer was solving algebra problems, proving logical theorems, and speaking English.
 By the mid-1960s this research was being generously funded by the US Department of Defense. These researchers made the following predictions:<P/>
 
 <P>*1965, e. a. Simon: "In twenty years, machines will be able to do whatever work a man can do."<P/>
 <P> *1967, Marvin Minsky: "Within a generation...the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will be largely solved."<P/>

<P>But they failed to realize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.
 In 1974, in response to criticism from England's Sir James Lightttle and persistent pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects,
 the US and British governments cut funding for all undirected exploratory research in AI, the first setback for AI research<P/>
 
<P> In the early 1980s, AI research experienced a new revival through the commercial success of "expert systems",
 an AI program that simulates the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts.
 By 1985, artificial intelligence research profits in the marketplace had reached more than $1 billion, and governments began funding again.
 A few years later, starting with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI research experienced another but longer setback.<P/>
 
 <P>In the 1990s and early 2000s, AI achieved even greater successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. AI is used in logistics, data mining,
 medical diagnostics and many other areas across the technology industry. This success is due to several factors:
 the great power of computers today (see Moore's Law), the increased focus on solving specific sub-problems,
 the creation of new relationships between the field of artificial intelligence and other areas of work on similar problems,
 and above all researchers have begun to adhere to strong mathematical approaches and strict scientific standards.<P/>

<P>In the twenty-first century, AI research has become so highly specialized and technical,
 that it has split into so deeply independent sub-fields that they are few among themselves.
 Divisions of the field have grown around particular institutions, researchers have worked to solve specific problems,
 long-standing differences of opinion about how AI should work, and different tools are widely applied.<P/>
